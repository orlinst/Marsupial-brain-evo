# Marsupial-brain-evo

Running a smooth MCMC on marsupial brain evolution data



`mcmc.Rmd` - a quite messy extended MCMC tutorial on my data

`script_markdown.Rmd` - pgls's, ancestral state estimations etc. At the end, this should be the complete file with analysis redirtecting to mice and neatMCMC.


`mice.Rmd` - Multiple imputation on missing data of my dataset

`surface.Rmd` - Surface, analysis of convergence

`neatMCMC.Rmd` - amazing MCMC with streamlined analysis of imputed sets, pooling, plotting etc!
