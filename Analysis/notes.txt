Chaeropus_ecaudatus - extinct

Isoodon macrourus  With the reversal of light-dark (LD) cycles, most animals re-entrained within 8–15 days (Armstrong et al. 1990). However, 1 or 2 did not entrain, and persisted with their original cycle in this unstable entrainment for 50 days in the reversed light-dark cycles, indicating (as suggested by Lyne’s [1981] studies of 2 other peramelids) that bandicoots may have different circadian pacemakers than other mammals.


anc on body and brain (NG vs Aus) and ask

wether brain or body drive enc (I can incorporate all the NG species)

body size on American mars from lit

calculate body mass ranges (or SD?)

how about bipedality vs others?

compare variation in brain size or body size along the phylogeny (estimate evo rate )
