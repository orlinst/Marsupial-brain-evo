This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
data <- read.csv("./Data/marsALL.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
tree <-read.tree("./Data/tree176.nwk")
```

Subset log and norm
```{r}
data1 <- as.data.frame(data$BodyN)
data1 <- cbind(data$Brain, data1)
rownames(data1) <- data$Names
colnames(data1) <- c("Brain", "Body")
data1 <- log(data1)
stdize = stdize = function(x, ...) {(x - min(x, ...)) / (max(x, ...) - min(x, ...))}
data1$Brain <- stdize(data1$Brain)
data1$Body <- stdize(data1$Body)
```

RRphylo
```{r}
RR <- RRphylo(tree, data1)
search.conv(RR,tree,data1, PGLSf=TRUE,nsim=1000,rsim=1000, clus=.5, min.dist = 3, foldername ="Data")
search.shift(RR, auto.recognize = "yes", test.single = "no", status.type= "clade", foldername ="Data")
#cov = can add covariate
